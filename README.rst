The Open Budget project is a web app and API for the storage, access, and manipulation of budgetary data.

It is written in Python and JavaScript, using frameworks and libraries such as Django, D3, Backbone, Uijet, and Jquery.

Open Budget is especially useful for comparing budgets and actuals over time, and across *related* entities.

V1 of Open Budget has been designed as a platform for the budgets  of municipality governments in Israel, with an eye to wider applicability in budget comparison for government, commercial, and non-profit entities.

Open Budget is open source software and licensed under a BSD license.

Open Budget is a project of HaSadna (the Public Knowledge Workshop), a non-profit organization in Israel dedicated to data transparency in government.
